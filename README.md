<p>
  My real name is Ivan. I'm a 2nd-year Information Technology student from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines â€“ Sta. Maria, Bulacan Campus.
</p>

<p>
  Iâ€™m into cybersecurity â€” not just because it sounds cool, but because I genuinely enjoy learning how things work, how they break, and how they can be defended. I'm active in CTFs, I hunt bugs on the side, and I spend a lot of time researching how malware operates. Iâ€™ve also written a few for educational purposes.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ§  A Bit About Me</h2>

<p>
  Iâ€™m the quiet type. I enjoy being alone, and most of the time I just sit down with my laptop and dive deep into my own world. But when you bring up anything tech-related, I can talk nonstop. Whether itâ€™s exploits, shellcode, weird bugs, or how a certain vulnerability works â€” Iâ€™m in.
</p>

<p>
  I don't consider myself naturally smart, but I am consistent. I fail a lot, but I learn every single time. I build tools, break things, study hard, and try to improve every day â€” even if it's just by 1%.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ’» What I Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CTF Player</strong> â€“ I play CTFs to sharpen my skills and test myself against tough challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Bug Bounty Hunter</strong> â€“ I report real bugs in real systems and contribute to making the internet safer.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Researcher</strong> â€“ I study vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and explore anything that can teach me something valuable.</li>
  <li><strong>Malware Developer</strong> â€“ I write and test malware samples for educational purposes â€” it's part of how I learn how attackers think.</li>
</ul>
